## Collaboration Policy

The free flow of discussion and ideas is encouraged. <b> But, everything you turn in must be your own work </b>, and you must note the names of anyone you collaborated with on each problem and cite resources that you used to learn about the problem. If you have any doubts about whether a particular action may be construed as cheating, ask the instructor for clarification before you do it. Cheating in this course will result in a grade of F for course and the [University policies](https://communitystandards.umn.edu/avoid-violations/avoiding-scholastic-dishonesty) will be followed.

No code can be communicated, including verbally. Explicit use of external sources must be clearly cited.

## Students with Disabilities
If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and [Disability Resources Center](https://disability.umn.edu/) (DRC).
