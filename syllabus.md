## About

The objective of this course is to introduce students to the principles of robotics. The main topics of interest covered in the class include: transformations in 3D, kinematics, inverse kinematics, velocity kinematics, and introduction to robot programming with the Robot
Operating System (ROS). If time permits, we will address other issues such as dynamics and those related to mobile robots, primarily sensing, estimation, and autonomous navigation later in the semester. Robot programming will be introduced in the context of the final
project.

This course builds on and is indebted to materials from - 
- Prof. Chad Jenkins (Univ of Michigan),
- Prof. Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos (Univ of Minnesota), 
- Prof. Junaed Sattar (Univ of Minnesota), and 
- Professor Elizabeth A. Croft (Dean, College of Engineering, Monash University, Australia).

## Modality

This section (002) of the course CSCI5551 is scheduled to be held in person, in Rapson Hall 45 on Mondays and Wednesdays 1:00PM-2:15PM Central Time. The lectures will not be recorded. Students are required to attend lectures in person, as long as health and safety concerns and university regulations do not prevent them from doing so. In any case, it is highly recommended to keep the instructor informed of any circumstances that might be of concern for administering the course.

**Note:** If you want to access via UNITE you will have to register for section (001) taught by Prof. Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos.

There will be no exams (i.e., midterms or final) in this year’s offering; all evaluation will thus take place in the form of homework, programming assignment, project presentations, demos, and reports. 
<!-- See Section 6 for detail grade breakdown. -->

## Textbook

There is no required textbook for this course, however optional readings will be suggested from the textbook:
[1] (Optional) K. Lynch, F. Park, “Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control”, Cambridge University Press New York, NY, USA, 1st Edition, 2017 (ISBN-13:9781107156302).
[2] (Optional) J. Craig, “Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control,” Pearson Prentice Hall, NJ, 4th edition, 2017 (ISBN-13: 9780133489798).
[3] (Optional but recommended for ROS) Wyatt Newman. “A Systematic Approach to Learning Robot Programming with ROS”. Chapman & Hall. Print ISBN: 9781315152691, 131515269X, eText ISBN: 9781498777872, 1498777872, Edition: 1st. This is freely available through the UMN libraries to students and staff here - [link](https://primo.lib.umn.edu/permalink/01UMN_INST/kj5btb/alma9975440385601701).

<!-- ## Lectures

Lectures will take place in-person on **Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2:30-3:45 PM CT in Rapson Hall 58**. 
Remote access will be made available for the following reasons:
- Weather impediment: Zoom link will be sent out via email prior to the lecture
- Health reasons: Email kdesingh@umn.edu before the lecture with the reason to attend via Zoom, to obtain the meeting ID and password.  -->


## Programming Projects

You will complete programming [projects](/CSCI5551-Fall23-S2/projects/) over the course of the semester. 
<!-- All projects will be implemented using Python, Pytorch and Google Colab. -->

<!-- ## Final Project

Instead of a final exam at the end of the semester, you will complete a final project working in groups of 1 to 3 students.

The final project will entail five core deliverables: (1) a written review of a paper (2) an in-class paper presentation, (3) reproducing the published results of an existing deep learning paper, (4) extending the chosen paper's methods and (5) documenting your reproduction and extension in a written report.

The objective of the final project is for you to gain experience with state of the art approaches in deep learning and a sense of how research in the area is conducted.

## Quizzes

Throughout the semester, there will be a total of 16 quizzes administered through [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/481744){:target="_blank"}. These quizzes will be posted before lecture sections throughout the semester and be available to take until the beginning of lecture that same day. Quizzes will be released at 7:00AM CT and must be submitted by 2:30PM CT. Each quiz will have a 15 minute time limit. Each quiz will consist of 1 or 2 short questions within the scope of previously covered lectures and graded projects. -->

<!-- ## Grading Policy

Course grades will be determined according to the following criteria:

 - Project 0:     12%
 - Project 1:     12%
 - Project 2:     12%
 - Project 3:     12%
 - Project 4:     12%
 - Final Project:

   - Paper Reproduction: 12%
      - Algorithmic extension to obtain results on new data/idea/technique
   - Video and poster: 4%
   - Final report: 2%
 - 16 Pre-Lecture Quizzes: 16% (1% each) -->

## Collaboration Policy

The free flow of discussion and ideas is encouraged. <b> But, everything you turn in must be your own work </b>, and you must note the names of anyone you collaborated with on each problem and cite resources that you used to learn about the problem. If you have any doubts about whether a particular action may be construed as cheating, ask the instructor for clarification before you do it. Cheating in this course will result in a grade of F for course and the [University policies](https://communitystandards.umn.edu/avoid-violations/avoiding-scholastic-dishonesty) will be followed.

No code can be communicated, including verbally. Explicit use of external sources must be clearly cited.

## Students with Disabilities
If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and [Disability Resources Center](https://disability.umn.edu/) (DRC).

## Discussion Forum

The [Ed Stem](link){:target="_blank"} discussion forum is available for discussion of course materials including lectures and projects. 
<b>Any discussion of quizzes and verbatim code on the Ed Stem forum must be posted privately.</b>
