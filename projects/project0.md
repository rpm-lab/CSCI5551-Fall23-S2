# Project 0

## Overview
The objective of the first project is to gain experience workin with JavaScript, Web Debugging, and the Autograder. In this project you will implement 5 simple functions with JavaScript.


## Instructions

1. <b>Download the project starter code</b>
    - [Project 0 starter code: P0.zip](/CSCI5551-Fall23-S2/assets/projects/P0/P0.zip)

2. <b>Unzip the starter code and open `home.html` in a Google Chrome</b>
    - Once unzipped, you should find files `home.html` and `home.js`. Try opening `home.html` to see what it looks like. It should look like this:

    ![P0_home_html.png](/CSCI5551-Fall23-S2/assets/projects/P0/P0_home_html.png)

3. <b>Go through the questions until you "PASS" all test cases.</b>
    - Each line with "Result: FAIL" should change to "Result: PASS" once you implement the function correctly.

4. <b>Submit your `home.js` file for grading</b>
    - The autograder is still being set up on the department's side, so we'll update the link here as soon as that's done.

## Deadline

This project is due on <b>Wednesday, September 20th at 11:59pm CT</b>.
